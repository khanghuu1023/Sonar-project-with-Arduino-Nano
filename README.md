# Sonar-project-with-Arduino-Nano
## Project summary:
An ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04, measuring distance away from objects, is attatched to a microservo SG90 which controls the motion of the sensor back and fort from 0-180 deg.

When an object is detected by the ultrasonic sensor within the range of 40cm, a passive buzzer will go off.

All these components are monitored by an Arduino Nano.

The visual interface of the sonar are written in Processing, which graphical library using Java. This provides visual information about angle of the servo, positio
